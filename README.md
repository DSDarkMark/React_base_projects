```
which is show your post is created successfully.

#### How to automate using **github-actions**.

You can always set that script in your local system by using **corn job** to upload posts on LinkedIn or you can use **github-action** for this work.

here is to set GitHub action to run that script with a fixed interval of time.

1. Go to your action tab and create action and paste that code:

```yml
name: Run Node.js Script

on:
  push:
   branches: master
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 */24 * * *"      

env:
  ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.BASE_URL }}
  CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}
  CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}
  MEMES_URL: ${{ secrets.MEMES_URL }}
  REDIRECT_URI: ${{ secrets.REDIRECT_URI }}

jobs:
  run-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "16"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run script
        run: node src/main.js
```

2. you can set interval which you want to upload your post on linkedin by seting  `cron: "0 */24 * * *"` in above action.
3. Go to your repo setting and open that section and set these envroments:
```yml
env:
  ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.BASE_URL }}
  CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}
  CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}
  MEMES_URL: ${{ secrets.MEMES_URL }}
  REDIRECT_URI: ${{ secrets.REDIRECT_URI }}
